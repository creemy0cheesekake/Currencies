# ForexAide

Simple Full Stack React App made with TypeScript and SASS with a Node and Express backend, deployed to Heroku at https://forex-aide.herokuapp.com.
Uses the fcsapi.com Forex API

## About
Data is fetched from the 3rd party API, which is then sent to the client using a backend API, which is rendered on the screen in React. Only the top 77 most popular Forex pairs are shown.

## Limitations
Since I only have the free version of the API, only 3 calls per minute are allowed. This includes calls made by any other concurrent users. This application is not designed to support a large number of users, as that would require me to upgrade to a paid API.

## Please report any issues that you may find, that would be greatly appreciated!
